# DevelopingDataProducts

This repository contains my project reports for the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health **Developing Data Products** class.  

It contains two folders, 1 for each of the project. 

* the first is the `shiny` project folder which contains the `app.R` file and the `www` folder. The `www` folder contains the `css` file used to build the `shiny` document.

*	the second folder contains the `slidify` project report.
